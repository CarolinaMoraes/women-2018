			<h1>Alicia Keys</h1>
			<p class="text-block"> 
				While watching The Voice videos I discovered Alicia Keys. Of course I knew her hits just as anybody else, but when I watched
				her talking I really discovered a great person who has a very authentic personality, is very truthful and has the ability to fill 
				a room with joy. She is crazy talented and has a very creative mind. I only can be thankful for her being alive in the same world as I do.

			<h1>Florence Welch</h1>
			<p class="text-block reverse"> 
		Sometimes I wish I could forget the Florence + the Machine songs so I could listen to all of them again for the first time.
		Her voice sounds just like a living and breathing miracle. She overcomes the impossible with her songs. The lyrics, the performances, the voice itself. ugh. So much talent for so few lines that I can write. 
		A magical person, thank god she exists. 
		(I really feel the need to go to her concert before I die)

			<h1>Letrux</h1>
			<p class="text-block"> 
				I discovered Letrux by accident. What a lovely accident. I listened to one song of hers one day before going to a music festival that she was going to play. I loved the energetic music and her vibe. I was missing something like her in my native language.

			<h1>Lianne La Havas</h1>
			<p class="text-block reverse"> 
				The Tiny Desk Concert series of videos on NPR YouTube's channel is one of the most enjoyable content from that platform. It was through one of these videos that I discovered Lianne La Havas, her music is very good and captivating. I read a commentary that really sums up how her music makes you feel, they said "her voice sounds like a smile after an unexpected compliment".

			<h1>Lorde</h1>
			<p class="text-block"> 
				November 15th, 2018, 9:07 pm. That's the moment that the best time of my life began. I went into Lorde's concert.
				What a queen on stage (outside too, but let's focus), so much charisma and talent in the same person.
				Such a genius with a unique mind, voice, aesthetic sense, elaborated lyrics and sincereness.
				She has two albums and my whole heart. I don't know if you noticed but yes I'm a fan.

			<h1>St. Vincent</h1>
			<p class="text-block reverse"> 
				When I first listened to St Vincent songs I didn't enjoy much. But that is because she is different from what I expected, and that's the whole deal, she's great exactly because of this.
				This year I tried to listen to her again, and this time things went great. She's really powerful and really impressive on guitar playing (and singing too) and what's the most fun is the fact that she knows how to be inovative and interesting and still balances that with technique. Well, she's incredible.
